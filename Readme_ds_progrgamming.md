# Theory 

# exploratory analysis

1.  normalization z normalization 


    from ever point remove averageg the mean and then devide with variance 
    
    why ? we set the data in a normal sscale and now every data point is treated equally , 
    
    since in every  feature value is represeanted in a correlation the rest relavant feature values. 
    
2. binding 

   real value data are separated rgouped in buckets it helps analysis
   
3. curse of dimentionality 

    high dimentional data and a lot of noise . 
    
    the importance of PCA principal component analysis 
    
    finds the coovaration matrix , and the basic dianysma so data can be represented by this minimal dianissma 
    
# Clustering data 

## k-means 

we need to give as input the possible centers 
#### algorithms randomly selects center values 
calculates euclidian disctance from center 
adjust centers and re runs 

## k-medodis 

we need to give as input the possible centers 
#### we select datapoints as centers at initialization 
calculates euclidian disctance from center 
adjust centers and re runs
