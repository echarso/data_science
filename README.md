# what are the axioms so a decission to be rational

1.prospective orientation : decission should be based on the consequences

2.transitivity : if A>B , B>C then A>C

3.invarience : same options should lead to same decession no matter what how the options are phrased

4.indepedent from irrelevant alternativess : 
if i preffer A over  B then i should continue prefer A > B not matter if a 3rd alternative come 

# components of a decission

1. alternatives : what you can choose to do

2. objectives : what is to acheived

3. consequences : what happens if an alternative is choosen and a particular event takes place

4. uncertainities : what is outside of our control comes with events

5. preferences : ranking gof conssequences

### One alternative imply a number of possible consequences each one with a propability

alternative/ decision nodes

event/propability nodes

consequence / value nodes
